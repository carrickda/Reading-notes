# Delta V class 102

Hi My name is David Carrick and I live in Cedar Rapids Iowa. I have done a lot of different things in my lifetime. My undergrad degree was Mathmatics with and emphesis in Secondary Education. I spent time in the Education field as a tutor and full time teach in both Ohio and Georgia. I have a M.A. in Minstry from Grace College and Seminary in Indiana and have spent time as both a Senior Pastor and Youth Pastor. I have volenteered at a local alternative high school and worked with their robotics team. I am also a gamer and twitch streamer. Those two things are what have prompted my interset in coding.

## Growth Midset

### What is the growth mindset?

The growth midset is a close companion of *grit*. What is *grit* you may ask? *Grit* is what I call ***stick-to-itness***. *Grit* says that no matter what the challenge I will stick to the task until it is done. Growth mindset needs *grit*. Growth mindset adds to the ***stick-to-itness*** with a purpose of learning. There are some people I know that have *grit* but not a growth mindset. They will stick to a task for the purpose of finishing the task and not necessarly learn anything from it. There are also people I know who have a growth mindset, they havbe a desire to learn and believe they can learn but sometimes lack the *grit* to keep going when things get difficult and say I have learned enough. I believe that to be successful you need both growth mindset and *grit*.  

### Things I need to do to keep a growth mindset

1. **GET GRIT** Sometimes I give up early on the learning becasue I don't think the lesson is worth the effort. I need to just push through and finish just to finish.  
2. **Remind myself the lesson is worth the effort** See number one.  
3. **Focus on the learning instead of the effort needed to learn** I am always looking at the most efficient and effective ways to do things and I need to stop looking at whether it is efficient and focus on the fact that I am learning.
