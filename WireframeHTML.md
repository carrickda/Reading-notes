# Lessons from the Wireframe and HTML Readings

## Wireframing

### What is wireframing  

In simpliest terms wireframing is a simple sketch of the layout of your website. You use shapes, simple color (not for design but to distinish different parts) and limited text (only for discriptive purposes). **Don't get caught up ini details**

### Steps for wireframing

1. Research - Who is your audience and what are they looking for?
2. User flow - Where do you want the usert to go and how do they get there?
3. Wireframe draft - Test what goes where, pictures videos, articles, buttons. What do they look like in differnt spots. Keep somple
4. Add detail - Once figure out what goes where now use simple instructional wording, login, logo, text body, etc. so developer knows what they are.

## HTML

### What is HTML

HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the code used to structure a webpage. It is the "facts" part of the webpage. It consists of a series of different elements that are made up of 3 different parts, opening tag, closing tag and the content inbetween. These parts determine how the content appears or acts on the Web page. Elements can also have attributes which contain extra information but do not appear in the content. There are different tags that determine how each element appears or functions on the page. An example on one element is below.

~~~bash
<h3>This is my Header</h3>
The whole thing is the elemante. The <h3> is the opening tag, "This is my header" is the content and </h3> is the closing tag
