# Notes on Jave Script

## Notes form Video's

All computers do these 4 things -  

1. Take input
2. Store it
3. Process it
4. Output it somehow

Computers use 1's and 0's called binary system to represent everything. Everything from numbers to letters to pictures to video's to sound can be represented with a series of 1's and 0's.  

Processors are made up of circuits. There are lots of different kinds of circuits to do different things and that is what processes the input information of 1's and 0's.

The central processing unit (CPU) is what takes the input and uses the software in memory to perform the action and then outputs it to the operating system which sends it to the different output devices or hardware.

## Notes from Reading

Java Script (js) is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with forst-class functions. JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.  

We can distinguish 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as "JavaScript".

1. The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.
2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.
3. The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
