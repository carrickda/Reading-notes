## What is the growth mindset?

The growth midset is a close companion of _grit_. What is _grit_ you may ask? _Grit_ is what I call ***stick-to-itness***. _Grit_ says that no matter what the challenge I will stick to the task until it is done. Growth mindset needs _grit_. Growth mindset adds to the ***stick-to-itness*** with a purpose of learning. There are some people I know that have _grit_ but not a growth mindset. They will stick to a task for the purpose of finishing the task and not necessarly learn anything from it. There are also people I know who have a growth mindset, they havbe a desire to learn and believe they can learn but sometimes lack the _grit_ to keep going when things get difficult and say I have learned enough. I believe that to be successful you need both growth mindset and _grit_.
