# Letter to a friend

Hey Mark,

I know you said when we were golfing that you were interested in learning to code but didn't know where to start or if it was possible with your non-technical background. I am here to tell you that **yes you can**. I am taking this class at Delta V right now and just wanted to share some of the cool things I am learning.  

## Growth Mindset

First off I know you don't think you can learn coding but one of the things we have looked at  in class is a *growth mindset*. A growth mindset says that with enough effort and time I can learn anything I want, I just need to put in the time and effort. So I believe that you can learn to code. Now will it be as fast as other people probably not but most people don't pick up woodworking the way you did either. We all have our strengths but just because something isn't a strength doesn't mean you can't learn it and make it a strength.  

## Markdown  

Now on to more of the technical side of things. Coding is a language just like any other language. The best way to learn a language is to immerse yourself in it. Which is what they do at Delta V. Right now we are learning about markdown in Github. Now just like in english when you right a letter to someone you need to use correct grammar and spelling so the person understands it. In coding it is the same thing except instead of writing to a person you are writing instructions for the computer in it's language so it can understand it. For instance we all know that in English you always start a sentence with a capitol letter. In markdown you usually start with a header that you can make different sizes and boldness such as:

```bash
### Header
#### Header
##### Header
```

Gives you  

### Header

#### Header1

##### Header2

That is just one example of markdown so the computer know what to do. All you and I need to do is immerse ourselves in the language and soon enough we will be speaking markdown fluently.  

Have a good rest of your day
