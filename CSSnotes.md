# Notes on CSS

## What is CSS

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It allows you to style and make webpages look better, more pleaseing to look at and easier to navigate. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

## How CSS works

The CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style.
We then have a set of curly braces { }.
Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (color for example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red for example).
There can be multuiple declarations, one for color and the other for font-size for example. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.

## Three ways to insert CSS

1. External - A seperate style sheet that is referenced to inside a *link* elelment inside the head section of the HTML page.
2. Internal - Can be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. It is defined inside the *style* element inside the head section.
3. Inline - Used to apply a unique style for a single element. You add the style attribute to the revelent element.
